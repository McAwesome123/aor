Aegis of Rhodon - the doughbyte idle(?) game

## Building

AOR uses Qt5. In one way or another, you must have it to build.

On Windows, Qt is linked statically. You will need to have statically compiled Qt5 binaries - you will likely need to compile them yourself. On Linux, QT is linked dynamically, and you will need Qt5 to be installed.

The build script on Windows requires the Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt and uses ImageMagick to convert images to grayscale.

Build requirements on Linux may differ.
