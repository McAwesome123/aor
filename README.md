# aor
Aegis of Rhodon - the doughbyte idle(?) game

## Building

AOR uses Qt5. In one way or another, you must have it to build.

On Windows, Qt is linked statically. You will need to have statically compiled Qt5 binaries - you will likely need to compile them yourself. On Linux, QT is linked dynamically, and you will need Qt5 to be installed.

There are some other dependencies (e.g. for the build scripts), but I will not give a complete overview of building the project here. If you need help building, [contact me](mailto:pierce@doughbyte.com).

## Contributing

**Reporting issues:** If you're from the Solving Stratzenbyte Discord, just report issues there. Otherwise, you can make an issue here.

**Pull requests:** I'll accept your PRs - I enforce no commit or PR format or anything, but please try to maintain the same coding style and do not introduce new dependencies.
