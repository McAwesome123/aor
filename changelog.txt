b2.0.0

[v] (game) Added exploring! Dissassemble food, tools and artifacts to learn the map of Rhodon and discover new places, then choose somewhere to move once your explorers have enough resources to make the passage. Each location has unique effects and special items to find, but they only have a limited number of resources - so don't get too comfortable where you are.
