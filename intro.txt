Aegis of Rhodon

the multiplayer idle game of exploration, growth, and death

The Tree of Roses sprouts from a seed embedded in the steel veil, driving a spear between worlds segregated for eons by an ancient seal. From the rushing melange of energy came forth the world of Rhodon; a vibrant land of silicon grass, data leaves, and abstract creeks, where nature and artificial are fused in stunning symbiosis.

The living will come to harvest Rhodon. The insatiable hunger of their beating flesh will rip the electron-speckled fruit and dendritic metals from her brittle golden skeleton. They will persist in their hedonistic violation of the land, until cracks in the sky bleed only with quiet air and her circuits of roses dither to sparkling pixels.

The dead will come to her defense.
