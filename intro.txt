The Tree of Roses sprouts from a seed embedded in the steel veil, driving a spear between worlds kept apart by an ancient seal. From the rushing melange of energy came forth the world of Rhodon; a vibrant land of silicon grass, data leaves, and abstract bark, where nature and artificial are fused in unprecedented symbiosis.

The living will come to harvest Rhodon. The insatiable hunger of their beating, bloody flesh will drive them to rip the electron-speckled fruit and dendritic metals from its brittle golden skeleton. They will persist in their violation of the land until cracks in the sky bleed only with quiet air and the circuits of roses dither to sparkling pixels.

The dead will come to its defense.
