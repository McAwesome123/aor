(dev) Several core systems have been re-written in anticipation of future content.
This is highly experimental, and I anticipate _many_ new bugs will be present
(game) Changed the mechanics of material slotting; previously, you were _unable_
to slot materials if they caused a particular resource to exceeded your smithing
tool's max capacity. Now, you are _able_ to slot materials regardless of your
tool's capacity, however you can still only craft items that your tool allows. This
makes it possible to, for instance, use a Cobolt Bar with a Maven Mallet to craft
a Seaquake, while still ensuring it isn't possible to craft a Deframgenter with
the Mallet. This should help materials be more flexible and generally valuable, as
previously very high-value materials couldn't be used _at all_ with lower-level tools
(game) Changed how Fennahian names are generated to make them more distinct from
canon doughbyte species
(game) When getting injured, explorers will now clear all non-eating and non-defiling
actions from their queues to avoid them killing themselves
(qol) Encryption has been (temporarily?) removed from save files to ease
debugging a bit
(qol) The bugcheck dialog has been reworked to make it more clear an
unintentional bug has occured
