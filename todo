(dev) Several core systems have been re-written in anticipation of future content.
They are now probably very unstable and I anticipate _many_ new bugs will be present
(game) Trying a new UI layout that creates space for future controls
(game) Changed the mechanics of material slotting; previously, you were _unable_
to slot materials if they caused a particular resource to exceeded your smithing
tool's max capacity. Now, you are _able_ to slot materials regardless of your
tool's capacity, however you can still only craft items that your tool allows. This
makes it possible to, for instance, use a Cobolt Bar with a Maven Mallet to craft
a Seaquake, while still ensuring it isn't possible to craft a Deframgenter with
the Mallet. This should help materials be more flexible and generally valuable, as
previously very high-value materials couldn't be used _at all_ with lower-level tools
(game) Changed how Fennahian names are generated to make them more distinct from
canon doughbyte species (yes, they aren't canon)
(bug) Fixed injuries displaying simply as "Level x" instead of "Level x Injury"
(qol) The crash dialog has been reworked to make it more clear an unintentional
bug has occured
(qol) Added an about screen
